# Student Grade Calculator 📊

This is a simple Java console-based application that calculates a student’s total marks, percentage, and final grade based on input marks from three subjects.

I built this to practice basic Java concepts like conditionals, input handling, and simple arithmetic logic.

This project was created as part of my personal learning journey in Java. It helped me revise basic syntax, control structures, and user input in Java. I may enhance it in the future with features like storing multiple student records or adding a GUI using JavaFX or Swing.
